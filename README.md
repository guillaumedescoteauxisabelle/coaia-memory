# COAIA Memory - Creative-Oriented AI Assistant Memory System

> MCP server implementing structural tension charts and advancing pattern support based on Robert Fritz's creative methodology

## What is COAIA Memory?

COAIA Memory extends traditional knowledge graphs with **structural tension charts** - a powerful framework for organizing creative processes around desired outcomes rather than problem-solving. Based on Robert Fritz's structural tension methodology, it helps AI assistants maintain creative orientation and support advancing patterns.

**Current Version**: v2.0.0-rc.1 (Release Candidate)

## Key Features

### üéØ Structural Tension Charts
- **Desired Outcomes**: Clear, specific results you want to create
- **Current Reality**: Honest assessment of where you are now  
- **Structural Tension**: The unresolved tension between current reality and desired outcome that naturally seeks resolution
- **Action Steps**: Strategic secondary actions - intermediary end results that advance toward the primary goal
- **Due Dates**: Time organization that creates momentum

### üî≠ Telescoping Support
- Break down complex action steps into detailed sub-charts
- Proper due date inheritance from parent steps
- Hierarchical navigation between overview and details
- Maintains structural tension at every level

### üìà Advancing Pattern Tracking
- Completed action steps become part of current reality, changing the structural dynamic
- Each completion advances the system toward equilibrium (desired outcome)
- Success creates new structural tension for continued advancement
- Prevents oscillating patterns through proper structural design

### üó£Ô∏è Natural Language Ready
- Conversational patterns documented for intuitive interaction
- Creative-oriented language (focus on creation vs problem-solving)
- AI assistants can guide users through structural tension exercises

### üîó Traditional Knowledge Graph
- Full entity, relation, and observation management
- Search and retrieval capabilities
- Compatible with existing MCP knowledge graph workflows

## Installation & Usage

### As NPX Package
```bash
npx coaia-memory --memory-path ./my-charts.jsonl
```

### In Claude Desktop Config
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "coaia-memory": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "coaia-memory", "--memory-path", "/path/to/your/charts.jsonl"],
      "autoapprove": [
        "create_structural_tension_chart",
        "telescope_action_step", 
        "mark_action_complete",
        "get_chart_progress",
        "list_active_charts",
        "create_entities",
        "create_relations",
        "add_observations"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Local Development
```bash
git clone <repository>
cd coaia-memory
npm install
npm run build
```

## Core Tools

### Structural Tension Chart Management
- `create_structural_tension_chart` - Create new chart with outcome, reality, and action steps
- `telescope_action_step` - Break down action steps into detailed sub-charts
- `mark_action_complete` - Complete actions and update current reality
- `get_chart_progress` - Monitor chart advancement
- `list_active_charts` - Overview of all active charts

### Traditional Knowledge Graph Operations
- `create_entities` - Add new entities (people, concepts, events)
- `create_relations` - Connect entities with relationships
- `add_observations` - Record new information about entities
- Plus full CRUD operations for entities, relations, and observations

## Example Usage

### Creating a Chart
```javascript
// Natural language: "I want to learn Python web development in 6 weeks"
{
  "desiredOutcome": "Learn Python web development", 
  "currentReality": "I know basic Python but no web frameworks",
  "dueDate": "2025-09-15T00:00:00Z",
  "actionSteps": [
    "Complete Django tutorial",
    "Build practice project", 
    "Deploy something live"
  ]
}
```

### Telescoping Detail
```javascript
// Natural language: "Break down the Django tutorial step"
{
  "actionStepName": "chart_123_action_1",
  "newCurrentReality": "Never used Django, familiar with Python basics"
}
```

### Tracking Progress
```javascript
// Natural language: "I finished the Django tutorial"
{
  "actionStepName": "chart_123_action_1"
}
```

## Creative Orientation Principles

### Focus on Creation, Not Problem-Solving
- **Use**: "I want to create...", "My desired outcome is..."
- **Avoid**: "I need to fix...", "The problem is...", "I want to stop..."

### Structural Tension Awareness  
- Always pair desired outcomes with current reality to create structural tension
- This unresolved tension naturally seeks resolution through advancement
- Action steps are strategic intermediary results that change the structural dynamic
- Completed actions flow into current reality, creating new tension for continued advancement

### Advancing Patterns
- Success builds on success
- Completed actions become part of current reality
- Momentum creates natural progression toward goals

## Development & Testing

### Build & Test
```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

### Test Environment
```bash
cd test-environment
claude-code  # Launch with pre-configured MCP setup
```

## Release Status

### ‚úÖ Validated in v2.0.0-rc.1
- **Core Structural Tension Charts**: Fully functional with proper entity relationships
- **Telescoping Support**: Action steps break down into sub-charts with due date inheritance
- **Advancing Pattern Tracking**: Completions flow into current reality, system advances naturally
- **MCP Integration**: All tools working correctly in Claude Code CLI environment
- **Real-World Testing**: Validated with actual user interactions in test environment

### Next Milestone
**Guided Chart Creation**: Transform from passive storage to active coaching system that helps users create meaningful structural tension charts with proper creative orientation validation.

## Architecture

### Enhanced Entity Types
- `structural_tension_chart` - Container for chart components
- `desired_outcome` - What you want to create
- `current_reality` - Where you are now

## Philosophy

COAIA Memory embodies the principle that **structure determines behavior**. By organizing memory around structural tension rather than problem-solving patterns, it naturally supports creative advancement and helps users build the life they want to create.

The system recognizes that structural tension is the fundamental organizing principle of the creative process - not a problem to be solved, but a generative force to be harnessed.
