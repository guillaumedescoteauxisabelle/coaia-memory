# üéØ COAIA Memory v2.0.0-rc.1 Release Candidate

**Release Date**: August 14, 2025  
**Type**: Release Candidate  
**Stability**: Production-ready for testing and feedback

## üöÄ Major Milestone: Structural Tension Chart Implementation

COAIA Memory v2.0.0-rc.1 represents a fundamental evolution in AI memory systems. This release candidate transforms traditional knowledge graphs into creative-oriented memory infrastructure based on Robert Fritz's structural tension methodology.

## ‚úÖ What's Ready for Production

### Core Structural Tension Features
- **Chart Creation**: Full implementation of desired outcome + current reality + action steps
- **Telescoping Support**: Break down action steps into detailed sub-charts with proper due date inheritance
- **Advancing Pattern Tracking**: Completions flow into current reality, creating natural system advancement
- **Progress Monitoring**: Real-time tracking of chart completion and next action identification

### Validated Functionality
- **Real-World Testing**: Successfully tested with guitar learning chart creation, telescoping, and completion tracking
- **MCP Integration**: All tools working correctly in Claude Code CLI environment
- **Data Persistence**: Robust JSONL storage with transactional integrity
- **Backward Compatibility**: Traditional knowledge graph operations fully preserved

## üéØ Release Candidate Validation Results

### Test Scenario: Guitar Learning Chart
**Desired Outcome**: "Learn to play guitar and perform 5 complete songs"  
**Current Reality**: "I've never played an instrument before and don't own a guitar"  
**Due Date**: November 14, 2025

#### ‚úÖ Successful Operations:
1. **Chart Creation**: Proper structural tension established between reality and outcome
2. **Action Step Generation**: 5 strategic steps with distributed due dates
3. **Telescoping**: "Find a qualified guitar teacher" telescoped into detailed sub-chart
4. **Completion Tracking**: "Buy a guitar and basic equipment" marked complete, flowed into current reality
5. **Progress Advancement**: System naturally advanced to next action step

#### ‚úÖ Technical Validation:
- Proper entity relationships (`creates_tension_with`, `advances_toward`)
- Due date inheritance working correctly (parent action step ‚Üí telescoped chart)
- Metadata preservation across all operations
- Chart hierarchy tracking with parent-child relationships

## üîß Installation & Setup

## üìú Structural Tension Principle

> "The unresolved tension between current reality and desired outcome naturally seeks resolution through strategic advancement. This is not a problem to be solved, but a generative force to be harnessed."

COAIA Memory embodies this principle at every level - from individual action steps to the overall system architecture. The RC validates that software can successfully implement and teach Robert Fritz's structural tension methodology.

## ‚ö° Quick Start

1. **Install**: `npx coaia-memory --memory-path ./charts.jsonl`
2. **Create Chart**: "I want to create [specific outcome] by [date]"
3. **Define Reality**: "My current reality is [honest assessment]"
4. **Add Actions**: "I need to [strategic secondary results]"
5. **Track Progress**: "I completed [action step]"
