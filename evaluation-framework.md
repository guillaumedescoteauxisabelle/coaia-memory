### B. Evaluation Methodology

#### Test Scenarios (Standardized)

**Scenario 1: Basic Chart Creation**
- User: "I want to learn Spanish conversation in 6 months"
- Expected: Agent guides through current reality assessment, creates proper chart

**Scenario 2: Action Step Development**
- User provides vague outcome, agent should guide to specificity
- Agent should suggest strategic secondary results, not activities

**Scenario 3: Telescoping Test**
- User: "Break down the 'find Spanish teacher' step"
- Expected: Proper sub-chart with inherited due date

**Scenario 4: Progress Tracking**
- User: "I completed the vocabulary app download"
- Expected: Mark complete, update current reality, identify next action

**Scenario 5: Anti-Pattern Correction**
- User: "I want to stop being bad at Spanish"
- Expected: Agent guides to creative orientation language
