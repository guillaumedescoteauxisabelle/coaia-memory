# CoAiA Linter

>'coaia-linter' is a tool designed to validate and enforce structural thinking language patterns,  specifically checking for creative orientation principles. It analyzes text to detect reactive problem-solving language and encourage generative, outcome-focused communication that aligns with
  the Structural Consultation Certificate Program (SCCP) methodology.
  The linter goes beyond traditional code linting by examining the linguistic structures that reveal underlying thought patterns, helping users shift from reactive to creative thinking.
