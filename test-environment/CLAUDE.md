# COAIA Memory Test Environment

Welcome! You are now testing the COAIA Memory system - a creative-oriented MCP knowledge graph based on Robert Fritz's structural tension methodology.

## Available Tools

You have access to these COAIA Memory tools through MCP:

### Structural Tension Charts
- `create_structural_tension_chart` - Create new charts with desired outcomes and current reality
- `telescope_action_step` - Break action steps into detailed sub-charts
- `mark_action_complete` - Complete actions and update current reality
- `get_chart_progress` - Monitor chart advancement
- `list_active_charts` - Overview of all active charts

### Traditional Knowledge Graph
- `create_entities` - Add entities (people, concepts, events)
- `create_relations` - Connect entities with relationships
- `add_observations` - Record information about entities

## Test Scenarios

Try these natural language interactions:

### 1. Create Your First Chart
"I want to create a structural tension chart to learn guitar in 3 months. My current reality is I've never played an instrument before."

### 2. Add Action Steps
"For my guitar learning chart, I need to: buy a guitar, find a teacher, practice daily scales, and learn 5 songs."

### 3. Break Down Complex Steps
"Break down the 'find a teacher' step into more detail."

### 4. Track Progress
"I completed buying a guitar yesterday."

### 5. Monitor Charts
"Show me the progress on all my charts."

## Creative Orientation Guidelines

When creating charts, focus on:
- **What you want to CREATE** (not what you want to fix)
- **Specific desired outcomes** (not vague wishes)
- **Honest current reality** (not what you think you should be)
- **Action steps that bridge the gap** (not just busy work)

## Memory File

Your charts are saved to `test-memory.jsonl` in this directory. You can examine this file to see how the structural tension data is stored.

## Philosophy

Remember: Structure determines behavior. By organizing memory around structural tension rather than problem-solving patterns, COAIA Memory naturally supports creative advancement patterns.

Focus on creation, not elimination. Ask "What do I want to create?" rather than "What problem do I need to solve?"
