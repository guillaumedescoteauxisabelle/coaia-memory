# Planned Features

## Multiple Memory Contexts

We plan to implement a memory context system that allows users to define and switch between multiple memory files. This feature will support both static named contexts and dynamic project-based memory paths, enabling AI models to access different memory stores for different projects while maintaining a clear and safe user experience.
